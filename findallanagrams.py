class Solution:
    
    """
    Description: Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s
    
    Time Complexity: O(len(s))
    Space Complexity: O(len(p))
    
    Approach: Sliding window
    - maintain a dictionary from patterns with count of each character, and match (initiate with 0)
    - match will be updated to len(p) when anagram is present
    - use a sliding window of size <= len(p), move it across and do the following:
      + increase count of the character by 1 in dictionary if outgoing character is present
      + reduce count of the character by 1 in dictionary if incoming character is present
      + for every instance: if count of a character is either 0 or 1:
        -> increase the match by 1 if count == 0
        -> decrease the match by 1 if count == 1
    - at every iteration, when match == len(p); record the index of outgoing character + 1
